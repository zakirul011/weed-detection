# Weed Detection in Crop Fields
## Objective:
Build a deep learning model that classifies crop field images as either “weed” or “no weed.” Early weed detection helps farmers manage weeds more effectively, improving crop health and yield.

Binary Classification: The model simply identifies whether weeds are present or not.
Relevance to Agriculture: Weed management is crucial in agriculture, and using AI for early weed detection is a trending topic.
Accessible for Beginners: This problem is manageable with CNNs, especially since you can find agricultural datasets with labeled weed images.
Methodology:
Data Collection:

Use datasets like the “Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset” from Kaggle or create a custom dataset by collecting images of fields with and without weeds.
Preprocess images to enhance clarity, adjusting contrast and brightness if needed.
Model Development:

Implement a CNN model and experiment with transfer learning for better feature extraction.
Use image augmentation (rotations, flips) to increase dataset variety and make the model robust against different field conditions.
Evaluation:

Evaluate model accuracy, precision, and recall, especially focusing on minimizing false positives and false negatives.
Fine-tune hyperparameters and test different architectures to achieve optimal performance.
Expected Outcome:
A binary classification model that detects the presence of weeds in crop field images. This model could eventually be used in autonomous weeding robots or other smart agricultural tools.
